## Matrix Clients

> All Matrix clients share the same underlying protocol — federated, decentralized, and E2EE by default. Differences below are client-level features only.  
> 💡 **Homeserver needed:** Use [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) or self-host with [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

## Privacy-Focused Centralized

> These platforms prioritize privacy but run on central servers. Self-hosted instances exist but **cannot communicate with each other** — they are isolated, not federated.

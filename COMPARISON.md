## Matrix Clients

All Matrix clients share the same underlying protocol: federated, decentralized, and E2EE by default (must be enabled by the client). The differences below are client-level only. All of them can communicate with each other and with any Matrix homeserver.

> 💡 A homeserver is required. You can use the free [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) server or self-host using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

**† Notes**

<details>
<summary>Element</summary>

- *Description:* The reference Matrix client. Feature-complete but primarily enterprise and power-user focused.
- *Architecture:* Federated (Matrix protocol)
- *Role Management:* Uses Matrix power levels rather than named roles — functional but less intuitive than Discord
- *Webhooks:* Possible via bridges but no native simple webhook URL
- *Gif Embed Support:* Basic embed support, GIF picker limited
- *Invite Links Guest Access:* Guest access exists in Matrix protocol but inconsistently surfaced in UI Invite workflow is complex — each user must be invited to each channel individually, not just to the space/server
- *Admin Gui:* Element Admin and Synapse-Admin available separately UI described as confusing and difficult for average users — security features add UX friction
- *Message Ttl:* Matrix protocol supports retention policies but implementation varies by homeserver and client
- *Persistent Voice Channels:* MatrixRTC supports persistent voice rooms but experience varies by client
- *Large Community Moderation:* Draupnir and Mjolnir bots provide moderation at scale but require setup
- *Community Discovery:* matrixrooms.info and other directories exist but discovery is fragmented and not integrated into clients
</details>

## Privacy-Focused Centralized

These platforms prioritize privacy and are open source, but run on a central server. Self-hosted instances exist but **cannot communicate with each other** — they are isolated, not federated.

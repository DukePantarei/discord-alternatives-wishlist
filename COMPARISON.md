## Matrix Clients

All Matrix clients share the same underlying protocol — federated, decentralized, and E2EE by default. The differences below are client-level only. All of them can communicate with each other and with any Matrix homeserver.

> 💡 A homeserver is required. You can use the free [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) server or self-host using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

## Privacy-Focused Centralized

These platforms prioritize privacy and are open source, but run on a central server. Self-hosted instances exist but **cannot communicate with each other** — they are isolated, not federated.

| **Platform** | **Description** | **Architecture** | **Open Source** | **Self-Hostable** | **Federated** | **End-to-End Encryption** | **No Ads** | **No Data Tracking** | **GDPR Compliant** | **Biometric Age Verification** | **Free to Use** | **Web App** | **Desktop App** | **Mobile App** | **Docker Install** | **Voice Chat** | **Video Chat** | **Screen Sharing** | **System Audio in Screen Share** | **Text Channels** | **File Sharing** | **GIF & Embed Support** | **Threads & Forums** | **Bots & Automation** | **Webhooks** | **Role Management** | **Server / Space Organization** | **Event Scheduling** | **Raid Planner / Group Activity Tools** | **Invite Links & Guest Access** | **Admin GUI** | **Migration Assistant** | **Bridges to Other Platforms** | **Discord API Compatible** |

## Matrix Clients

All Matrix clients share the same underlying protocol: federated, decentralized, and E2EE by default (must be enabled by the client). The differences below are client-level only. All of them can communicate with each other and with any Matrix homeserver.

> 💡 A homeserver is required. You can use the free [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) server or self-host using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

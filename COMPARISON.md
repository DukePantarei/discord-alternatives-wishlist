## Matrix Clients

All Matrix clients share the same underlying protocol — federated, decentralized, and E2EE by default. The differences below are client-level only. All of them can communicate with each other and with any Matrix homeserver.

> 💡 A homeserver is required. You can use the free [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) server or self-host using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

## Privacy-Focused Centralized

These platforms prioritize privacy and are open source, but run on a central server. Self-hosted instances exist but **cannot communicate with each other** — they are isolated, not federated.

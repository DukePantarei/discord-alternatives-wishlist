## Matrix Clients

All Matrix clients share the same underlying protocol: federated, decentralized, and E2EE by default (must be enabled by the client). The differences below are client-level only. All of them can communicate with each other and with any Matrix homeserver.

> 💡 A homeserver is required. You can use the free [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) server or self-host using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy).

**Element:**
- *Role Management:* Uses Matrix power levels rather than named roles — functional but less intuitive than Discord
- *Invite Links Guest Access:* Guest access exists in Matrix protocol but inconsistently surfaced in UI Invite workflow is complex — each user must be invited to each channel individually, not just to the space/server
- *Admin Gui:* Element Admin and Synapse-Admin available separately UI described as confusing and difficult for average users — security features add UX friction

**SchildiChat:**
- *Role Management:* Inherits Element's power levels system
- *Admin Gui:* Inherits Element Admin support

## Privacy-Focused Centralized

These platforms prioritize privacy and are open source, but run on a central server. Self-hosted instances exist but **cannot communicate with each other** — they are isolated, not federated.

<summary><strong>† Feature Notes</strong></summary>

**Stoat (formerly Revolt):**
- *E2E Encryption:* E2EE for DMs is planned but not yet released
- *Federated:* Each Stoat server is isolated. Separate accounts needed per server. No portable identity.
- *Ai Features Or Training:* No AI features currently
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Previously used AI-generated commits but removed them after community backlash. Developer explicitly states Stoat's foundation predates vibe-coding (public beta 2021, ChatGPT late 2022). Currently maintains strong anti-AI stance.
- *Self Hostable:* Available but not prominently documented. See: https://github.com/stoatchat/self-hosted

**Valour:**
- *Self Hostable:* Planned 'coming soon' but not available as of Feb 2026

**Blite Chat:**
- *E2E Encryption:* X3DH key agreement + symmetric ratchet for DMs. Sender Keys (Signal protocol) for group channels. AES-128-GCM for voice/video via mediasoup SFU. Server sees only ciphertext.
- *Self Hostable:* Lite mode: text only, 512MB RAM. Full mode: voice/video, requires UDP 40000-40100 open. SQLite, no external dependencies. Works with nginx/Traefik/Caddy or included Caddy for auto-HTTPS.
- *Open Source:* MIT licensed. Single large initial commit (developed privately, cleaned for open source release). Built heavily with AI assistance (Claude).
- *Federated:* Self-hosted but not federated. Each instance is isolated.
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Explicitly states 'Built heavily with AI assistance (Claude)' in documentation. Single large initial commit suggests AI-generated codebase cleaned for release.

**Echoed:**
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Backend coded from scratch. Frontend has 'bits and pieces' of AI assistance but not vibe-coded.

<summary><strong>† Feature Notes</strong></summary>

**Spacebar:**
- *E2E Encryption:* TLS transport encryption only
- *Ai Features Or Training:* No AI features currently
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Explicitly bans AI code: 'AI code due to not being GPLv3 compatible is not allowed in this repo'

**Fluxer:**
- *E2E Encryption:* Roadmap 2026: Opt-in 'secret chats' (ephemeral, E2EE sessions). No plans for full-platform E2EE. LiveKit supports E2EE for calls but not yet implemented.
- *Self Hostable:* Self-hosting not recommended at this time — documentation and support coming soon
- *Open Source:* AGPLv3 + CLA. CLA allows commercial licensing for companies wanting to run internally without copyleft. Committed to no paywalled features or forced upgrades.
- *Federated:* Roadmap 2026: Distributed E2EE federation relays, OAuth2 auth via home instance
- *Ai Features Or Training:* No AI features currently
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Developer uses LLMs as a 'rubber duck' debugging tool but writes all code personally. See: https://blog.fluxer.app/how-i-built-fluxer-a-discord-like-chat-app/

**Loqa:**
- *E2E Encryption:* E2EE for DMs only, not group channels

**DCTS:**
- *E2E Encryption:* TLS transport encryption only

**Zulip:**
- *Message Ttl:* Configurable message retention policies per stream
- *Ai Features Or Training:* No built-in AI features. Self-hosted option means user controls data.
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Strict AI policy: permits AI assistance but STRICTLY disallows AI commits with zero oversight. See: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
- *E2E Encryption:* E2EE ONLY for push notification content. Messages stored as plaintext in PostgreSQL.

**Rocket.Chat:**
- *Federated:* Matrix federation bridge available but not native
- *Message Ttl:* Configurable message retention per room
- *Ai Features Or Training:* AI chatbot integrations available via marketplace

**Databag:**
- *E2E Encryption:* Optional 'sealed topics' provide E2EE. Default unsealed to allow server-side features (streaming, processing). Admin cannot view sealed topics.
- *Federated:* Accounts on different Databag nodes can communicate. Federation protocol is Databag-specific, not Matrix/XMPP.

**Discourse:**
- *Ai Features Or Training:* No built-in AI features. Self-hosted forum software.
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Google Sheet community assessment: NOT vibe-safe. May contain AI-generated code.

**Mattermost:**

<summary><strong>† Feature Notes</strong></summary>

**Sharkord:**
- *E2E Encryption:* TLS transport encryption only — not end-to-end
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Minimal documentation, rapid development timeline. Status unclear.

**Kloak:**
- *E2E Encryption:* E2EE for DMs planned but not yet implemented
- *Open Source:* Closed source but built with privacy-first principles. Minimal data storage by design.
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Security breach pattern (Feb 2026) similar to Paracord suggests possible vibe-coded origin with inadequate security review. Platform lacks authentication on critical endpoints.

**Pulse Chat:**
- *Biometric Age Verification:* 'No government ID required' is a key selling point

**Osmium:**
- *Open Source:* Closed source commercial platform
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Google Sheet community assessment: NOT vibe-safe. May contain AI-generated code.

**Paracord:**
- *Open Source:* GitHub repository available but developed privately then dumped as single commit - no development history
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Confirmed AI-generated. Community security audit found 20+ vulnerabilities including RCE, unauthenticated endpoints, plaintext secrets. Developer admits 'built in a few evenings' with AI.
- *E2E Encryption:* No E2EE. JWT secrets stored in plaintext in config file.
- *Self Hostable:* UPnP auto-opens router ports by default, exposing server to internet without user awareness

**Voltage (VoltChat):**
- *Open Source:* GitHub repos available but extremely new (Feb 2026)
- *Federated:* Claims federation support ('Self-Volt') but unproven with no federated instances
- *E2E Encryption:* Listed in feature flags but implementation status unknown
- *Ai Generated Codebase:* Strong indicators: 10 commits with full-featured backend, comprehensive docs, federation/OAuth/CDN all at once, no development history, multiple simultaneous repos. Typical vibe-coding pattern.
- *Self Hostable:* Setup scripts provided but untested by community

**Concord:**
- *Open Source:* GitHub repo available but minimal activity - appears to be tutorial project

**Ripcord (New/2026):**
- *Open Source:* Website claims 'open source core' but no code published yet
- *Self Hostable:* Website claims self-hostable but no software exists to verify
- *E2E Encryption:* Website claims E2EE but no implementation to audit

**Nexus Chat (AjaxSelectButtonGames):**
- *Self Hostable:* Code on GitHub but runs on single centralized server wss://chat.404nerds.com
- *Open Source:* Code available but no clear license statement

**Nexus (Magnimont/NoError Studios):**
- *Open Source:* MIT licensed - proper open source
- *Self Hostable:* Developer states 'working on deployment options' - technically possible but undocumented

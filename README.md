# Matrix Client Wishlist
### A community-driven feature wishlist for the ideal privacy-first Discord alternative

> **Are you a Discord refugee?** You're not alone. This project was born from the growing wave of users looking for a privacy-respecting, open-source alternative to Discord. Ideally, one that doesn't scan your face, sell your data to the surveillance state, or push advertisements into your chats.

## What Is This?

This repository is a **structured, community-maintained wishlist** of features we want to see in a Matrix-based Discord alternative. Think of it as a public product roadmap, built by users, for developers.

Matrix is a powerful, decentralized, and federated open protocol for real-time communication. It already supports a lot of what Discord users love. However, the experience across clients is fragmented, and some key features are missing or hard to discover. This project aims to change that.

**If you're a user:** Browse the wishlist, vote on features you want, and submit new ideas.  
**If you're a developer:** Use this as a structured backlog to understand what the community actually needs.

## Why Matrix?

Unlike Discord, Matrix is:

- **Decentralized** — No single company controls the network. Anyone can run a homeserver.
- **Federated** — Servers talk to each other, just like email providers do.
- **Open source** — The protocol and most clients are fully open source.
- **Privacy-first** — End-to-end encryption available. No ads. No face scans.
- **Self-hostable** — You control your own data entirely.

> Think of Matrix like email. Homeservers are the providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.), and clients are the apps you use to read your mail (Outlook app, Apple Mail, Thunderbird). You can pick any combination, and they all talk to each other.

### What Already Exists

Many Discord-like features already exist across the Matrix ecosystem — they're just not always in one place or easy to find:

| Feature | Status | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Bots & automation | ✅ Exists | Matrix API, maubot |
| Large hosting / scaling | ✅ Exists | Synapse, Conduit, Dendrite |
| Web/video/GIF embeds | ✅ Exists | Commet, Element |
| Web interface | ✅ Exists | All major clients |
| Event schedule/calendar | ✅ Exists | Commet |
| Screen sharing | ✅ Exists (needs system audio) | Element, Commet |
| Voice & video chat | ✅ Exists | MatrixRTC + LiveKit |
| Role management | ✅ Partial | Client-dependent |
| Profile/nickname/avatar | ✅ Exists | Most clients |
| Docker installation | ✅ Exists | ESS, matrix-docker-ansible-deploy |
| Admin GUI | ✅ Partial | Element Admin, Synapse-Admin, Draupnir |

### What's Still Missing or Needs Improvement

- Migration assistant (from Discord — roles, channels, message history)
- Seamless invite URLs / anonymous/guest access with minimal friction
- Raid planner / event RSVP tools
- A single polished client that matches Discord's ease of use for non-technical users
- Better onboarding and education around the Server → Space → Room model
- Screen sharing with system audio
- Consistent UX across clients

## Client Landscape

Not sure which Matrix client to use? Here's a quick overview:

| Client | Best For | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Element](https://element.io) | Enterprise / power users | Reference client, most features, work-focused |
| [Cinny](https://cinny.in) | Discord-like UI | Clean, simple, actively developed |
| [Commet](https://commet.chat) | Feature-rich casual use | GIFs, stickers, events, voice channels |
| [FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im) | Mobile / simple UX | Very beginner friendly |
| [SchildiChat](https://schildi.chat) | Discord-like feel | Based on Element with extra features |

> **Note:** Element is the reference client but it is **enterprise-focused**, not designed for average users. If you're coming from Discord, try **Cinny** or **Commet** first. My recommendation would be Commet, Cinny does not appear to support a "Voice Channel" UI like Commet. Commet feels the most like Discord that I have found in Matrix clients so far.

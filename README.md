# Discord Alternatives Comparison
### A community-driven comparison of privacy-respecting, open-source chat platforms

> **Are you a Discord refugee?** You're not alone. This project was born from the growing wave of users looking for privacy-respecting, open-source alternatives to Discord. Basically, platforms that don't scan your face, sell your data, or push advertisements into your chats.

## What Is This?

This repository is a **structured, community-maintained comparison** of Discord alternatives across 22 platforms and 44 features so far. It's designed to help you make an informed decision about where to move your community.

I've compare platforms across five categories:
- **Matrix Clients** — Decentralized, federated, open protocol
- **Privacy-Focused Centralized** — Open source but centrally hosted (Stoat, Valour, Nerimity)
- **Self-Hosted Platforms** — Run your own instance (Zulip, Rocket.Chat, Spacebar, etc.)
- **Commercial Alternatives** — Polished products with varying privacy tradeoffs (Discord baseline, Root, Telegram)
- **Legacy & Niche** — Historical context and specific use cases (Guilded, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Signal)

**If you're a user:** Browse [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md) to see detailed feature matrices for every platform. Vote on features you want via GitHub Discussions.

**If you're a developer:** Use the [wishlist discussions](../../discussions) to understand what users actually need. The comparison tables show gaps where no platform excels yet.

## Quick Comparison

Not sure where to start? Here are some common paths:

| If you want... | Try... | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Easiest Discord transition** | Stoat (formerly Revolt) | Most Discord-like UI and features, EU-based, open source |
| **True decentralization** | Matrix (via Commet or Element) | Federated protocol — no single company can shut it down |
| **Best for large communities (1000+ users)** | Zulip + Jitsi | Topic-based threading scales well, strong moderation tools |
| **Self-host without technical hassle** | Zulip or Rocket.Chat | Mature platforms with good docs and Docker support |
| **Maximum privacy** | Matrix or Mumble | Matrix has E2EE by default; Mumble has true E2EE voice |
| **Discord bot compatibility** | Spacebar | Only platform where existing Discord bots work without modification |

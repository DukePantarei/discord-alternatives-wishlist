      "notes": "Matrix protocol's most mature client. E2EE by default using Olm (1-to-1) and Megolm (groups), inspired by Signal's Double Ratchet.\n\n⚠️ PERMISSION INHERITANCE PROBLEM: Matrix Spaces don't inherit permissions. Must manually configure permissions for EVERY SINGLE ROOM. Adding moderator role to 50-room space = 50 manual configurations. Synapse admin tools are bare-bones. Shell scripts often needed for bulk operations.\n\n⚠️ MODERATION REQUIRES DRAUPNIR: Cannot ban user from entire server without third-party tools. Must ban from each room individually. Draupnir bot (NLnet-funded, actively maintained) is ESSENTIAL for moderation at scale. Handles distributed ban lists, policy rooms, protection.\n\n⚠️ DEVICE VERIFICATION UX: Each new client (phone, desktop, different app) requires device verification via emoji/QR codes. Crypto is solid (prevents MITM attacks) but UX is brutal for non-technical users.\n\nBOT ECOSYSTEM: Maubot (Python framework) is mostly unmaintained graveyard. Draupnir is the exception - actively maintained, essential.\n\nBRIDGING STRENGTH: Native bridges for Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, IRC. Slack bridge retired by Matrix.org (must self-host). Fully supported by Matterbridge (30+ platforms).\n\nVOICE/VIDEO: Matrix 2.0 added Element Call. Works, not Discord-quality yet. Resource intensive (4GB RAM VPS sweats on group calls).\n\nReal-world assessment (mvh, Feb 2026): \"Choose Matrix if privacy, decentralization, and federation are non-negotiable. You have technical chops to deal with permission management hell. You're willing to run Draupnir for moderation.\"\n\nUsed by German Bundeswehr for classified communications, French government, International Criminal Court. Serious privacy and security credentials.",

Different from Matrix's federated model.\n\nMINIMAL BRIDGING: Community bridges exist for Discord (revcord) and Telegram only. NOT supported by Matterbridge. No IRC, Matrix, or Slack bridges.\n\nReal-world assessment (mvh, Feb 2026): \"Choose Stoat if you want Discord's UX exactly and are willing to wait for it to mature. Skip if you need production-ready software now, voice chat matters, or bridging is important.\" Recommendation: Wait until more mature.\n\nOriginally named Revolt, rebranded after cease-and-desist.

      "architecture": "Self-hosted or cloud-hosted",
      "notes": "⚠️ NO FEDERATION - MULTI-COMMUNITY DEALBREAKER: Every Zulip server is an island. 3 communities = 3 separate accounts. No single sign-on, no portable identity. Username@company.zulipchat.com completely separate from username@mydomain.com. Deliberate architectural choice prioritizing organizational control. 20 communities = 20 accounts/logins = NOT SUSTAINABLE.\n\nE2EE REALITY: E2EE ONLY for push notification content. Actual messages stored as PLAINTEXT in PostgreSQL by design. Team chose features over encryption. E2EE breaks: search, shared history, server-side features. If you need message-level E2EE, Zulip is not your platform.\n\nTHREADING MODEL: EVERY message must belong to a topic within a channel. Always. No exceptions. Can't just post \"hey what's up\" - must choose/create a topic. Solves large organization chat chaos (50 people, 8 conversations in one channel). Biggest barrier to adoption from Discord - feels weird at first.\n\nVOICE/VIDEO: No native persistent voice channels like Discord. Integration-based: click button, generates Jitsi/Zoom/BigBlueButton meeting link. Different paradigm entirely - not drop-in/hang-out voice.\n\nBOT ECOSYSTEM: 120+ native integrations (GitHub, Jira, Sentry, PagerDuty, etc.). Slack-compatible webhooks. Python bot framework is \"excellent\" - clean APIs, good documentation. Zapier and IFTTT support.\n\nBRIDGING: Native bridges for IRC (great), Matrix (bidirectional), Slack (bidirectional). Fully supported by Matterbridge. Legitimately good, not Matrix-level extensive but solid.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 2GB RAM (small), 4GB (production). PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ required. Very good Docker support.\n\nReal-world assessment (mvh, Feb 2026): \"Choose Zulip if you're running a technical organization where organized conversation matters more than casual chat. Skip if you need federation, message-level E2EE is required, or you're part of many communities (don't want 20 separate accounts).\"\n\nThreading model makes sense once you use it - conversations stay organized, notification management sane. But lack of portable identity across servers is dealbreaker at scale.",

      "architecture": "Self-hosted, open source (GPL-2.0)",
      "notes": "⚠️ CATEGORY ERROR: Discourse is modern FORUM software. Really good forum software. It is NOT chat and NOT a Discord replacement despite some attempting to use it that way.\n\nCHAT PLUGIN: Bundled chat plugin provides short-form, real-time-ish messaging. But Discourse is still async and forum-based at heart. You post, you wait, people reply. NOT instant messaging. If community expects real-time chat, will feel slow and clunky. If community wants thoughtful long-form discussion, Discourse is perfect.\n\nTRUST LEVEL SYSTEM: Gamifies moderation. Transparent mod actions. Best anti-spam tools in business. Reddit-style discussion without Reddit.\n\nBOT SITUATION: Discobot (built-in onboarding bot) is genuinely well done. Beyond that: custom bots via REST API. No plug-and-play marketplace. Growing ecosystem of AI chatbot plugins.\n\nBRIDGING: ONE-WAY ONLY. Chat Integration Plugin sends notifications OUT to Slack, Discord, Telegram, Matrix, Teams, etc. NOT bidirectional chat bridging. Experimental discourse-chat-matrix plugin exists but not production-ready. NOT supported by Matterbridge (Discourse isn't a chat protocol, doesn't fit bridging model).\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended. Docker-based deployment (heavily pushed). PostgreSQL and Redis. CDN highly recommended for media. Frequent updates.\n\nReal-world assessment (mvh, Feb 2026): \"Choose Discourse if you want a FORUM, not chat. Long-form discussion is your goal. Powerful moderation and trust systems needed. You're okay with async communication. Skip if you need real-time chat or bidirectional bridging.\"\n\nUse case: When your community actually wants Reddit-style forum discussion, not Discord-style instant messaging. Don't try to force it into being something it's not.",

# Contributing Guide

Thank you for helping build this wishlist! This project works because of community input. Here's how to contribute effectively regardless of your technical background.

---

## I'm Not a Developer

You don't need to know how to code to contribute meaningfully. Here's what non-technical users can do:

**Vote on features**
Go to [Discussions](../../discussions), open any feature idea, and upvote features that you believe should be supported. This tells developers what the community actually wants.

**Submit a feature idea**
Click **New Discussion** in the Discussions tab, pick the **💡 Features Ideas & Improvements** category, and use the template provided. Don't worry about getting it perfect, just describe what you want in plain language and someone can help structure it.

**Share this repository**
Post it to Reddit, Matrix rooms, Discord servers (ironic, I know), or anywhere people are discussing alternatives. The more voices, the better the wishlist.

**Correct mistakes**
If something in the README or comparison table is wrong, open an [Issue](../../issues) with the label `correction` and describe what's inaccurate.

## I'm a Developer

**Add or update platform entries**
The comparison tables in the README are maintained manually. If a platform adds a new feature or something is outdated:

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit `README.md` directly with the correction
3. Open a Pull Request with a brief explanation of what changed and a source link if possible

**Build something from this wishlist**
If you're implementing a feature from the discussions, please:
1. Comment on the relevant Discussion thread to let the community know
2. Link back to this repo from your project if you're comfortable doing so

**Improve the templates**
The feature request template lives in `feature_request.md`. If you have suggestions for making it clearer or more useful, open an Issue or a Pull Request.

## Submission Guidelines

To keep discussions useful and actionable:

- **Search first** — Check if your idea already exists before creating a new discussion
- **One feature per discussion** — Keep submissions focused so they can be voted on individually
- **Be specific** — Vague requests are hard to act on. "Better voice chat" is less useful than "Screen sharing with system audio capture on Linux"
- **Include examples** — Screenshots or links to Discord/Guilded/Slack implementations help developers understand what you mean
- **Be kind** — This is a community project maintained by volunteers
